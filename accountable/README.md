# Keep Me Accountable

Introduction to the App

## Prerequisites for further development

- Expo Go App for further dev
  - `App Store / Play Store`
- Supabase DB
  - `www.supabase.com`

## Get going

1. clone the repo
2. run npm install

## Troubleshooting

1. Consistant error that shouldn't persist?
   1. Try clearing the cache with `npx expo start --reset-cache`
note because this is in a monorepo had to remove react, react-dom, and react-native-web deps and change metro.config.js a bit.
